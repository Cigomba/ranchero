# Ranchero Painting
The prototype for a painting website I built from "scratch" for a friend. Still needs a bit of work, but not too shabby. 

# Tools
- Built mainly with VueJs, along with HTML, CSS, and JS.
- Uses the Unsplash API to generate random photos.
- Also includes Appointment Scheduling via Calendly
